## Usage

TODO: This gem was written to show customers on Engine Yard how they could add a simple (and SEO friendly) blog to their existing rails application in no time.

It was built on top of the Jekyll framework by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Warner</a> and uses the same config elements you're used to if you already use jekyll for blogging. Hope you enjoy!
